SkillUse uses GitHub OAuth for authentication, enabling access to skills stored in public and private repositories.

## login

Authenticate with GitHub using device flow OAuth.

```bash
skilluse login
```

This command:
1. Opens your browser to GitHub's device authorization page
2. Prompts you to enter a verification code
3. Stores the access token securely in your system keychain

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--force` | Re-authenticate even if already logged in |

### Example

```bash
# First-time login
skilluse login

# Force re-authentication
skilluse login --force
```

## logout

Remove stored GitHub credentials.

```bash
skilluse logout
```

This clears:
- Access token from system keychain
- GitHub App installations from config

## whoami

Display information about the current authenticated user.

```bash
skilluse whoami
```

Shows:
- GitHub username
- Profile URL
- GitHub App installation status
