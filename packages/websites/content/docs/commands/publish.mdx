Publish your locally created skills to a configured GitHub repository.

## Usage

```bash
skilluse publish <skill-name>
```

The skill must exist in your local skills directory (`.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`).

## Prerequisites

1. **Authentication**: You must be logged in with `skilluse login`
2. **Default Repository**: A default repo must be set with `skilluse repo use <repo>`
3. **Write Access**: You need write access to the target repository (via SkillUse GitHub App)

## Skill Requirements

Your skill directory must contain a `SKILL.md` file with required frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: A brief description of what this skill does
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the AI agent...
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Skill identifier (should match directory name) |
| `description` | Brief description of the skill's purpose |

## Examples

### Publish a Skill

```bash
# Create a skill locally first
# .claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md

# Publish to your default repository
skilluse publish <skill-name>
```

### Overwrite Existing Skill

If the skill already exists in the repository, you'll be prompted:

```
Skill Already Exists
Skill <skill-name> already exists in repository:
  <owner/repo>
Press Y to overwrite, N to cancel
```

## Workflow

1. Create your skill locally in `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`
2. Add a `SKILL.md` with required frontmatter
3. Test the skill with your AI agent
4. Run `skilluse publish <skill-name>`
5. Share the repository with others
