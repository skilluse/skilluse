---

SkillUse is a decentralized **Skills Registry** for AI agents. It enables teams to discover, install, create, and publish skills across multiple AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.).

## What are Skills?

A skill is more than a prompt template. It's an **executable SOP** that empowers AI agents with two complementary capabilities:

| Dimension | What It Provides |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Domain Knowledge** | Expert reasoning, best practices, decision frameworks |
| **Workflow Automation** | Executable SOPs that orchestrate agent tools |

Skills encode *how experts think* and *how work gets done*.

## For Every Knowledge Worker

Skills aren't just for programmers:

- **Copywriters**: Brand voice, content frameworks, editorial standards
- **Data Analysts**: Analysis methodologies, visualization patterns
- **Marketers**: Campaign workflows, audience research
- **Product Managers**: PRD templates, prioritization frameworks
- **Engineers**: Code review standards, deployment SOPs

## Tool Orchestration

Skills orchestrate the agent's native tools:

| Tool | Capability |
|------|------------|
| **Bash** | Execute CLI commands (git, docker, npm, aws...) |
| **Read** | Access files and data sources |
| **Write** | Create documents and code |
| **WebSearch** | Research and fact-checking |
| **WebFetch** | Access external resources |

**Bash is the universal connector**—bridging the agent to the entire CLI ecosystem.
