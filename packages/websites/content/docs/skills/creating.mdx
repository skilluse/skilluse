This guide covers best practices for creating skills that work well with AI agents.

## Skill Structure

Every skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with:

1. Frontmatter (required metadata)
2. Description (what the skill does)
3. Instructions (how to use it)

## Basic Template

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Brief description of what this skill does
version: 1.0.0
---

# My Skill

[One paragraph explaining the skill's purpose]

## When to Use

Use this skill when [specific scenarios].

## Instructions

[Detailed instructions for the AI]
```

## Writing Good Instructions

### Be Specific

Instead of:
> "Review the code"

Write:
> "Review the code for: 1) Security vulnerabilities 2) Performance issues 3) Code style violations"

### Provide Examples

Show the expected output format:

```markdown
## Output Format

Provide feedback in this format:

### Issues Found
- [severity] Description of issue
  - File: path/to/file.ts
  - Line: 42
  - Suggestion: How to fix it
```

### Set Boundaries

Define what the skill should and shouldn't do:

```markdown
## Scope

DO:
- Check for SQL injection
- Validate input sanitization

DO NOT:
- Modify code automatically
- Run tests
```

## Testing Skills

Test your skill by:

1. Installing it locally
2. Asking your AI agent to use it
3. Verifying the output matches expectations

## Sharing Skills

Once tested, share skills with the publish command:

```bash
# Set your default repository
skilluse repo use <owner/repo>

# Publish the skill
skilluse publish <skill-name>
```

Or manually by:

1. Pushing to a GitHub repository
2. Adding the repo: `skilluse repo add <owner/repo>`
3. Installing: `skilluse install <skill-name>`

See [Publish Command](/docs/commands/publish) for more details.
