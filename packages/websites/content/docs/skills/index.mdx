# Skills

Skills are reusable prompt templates that extend AI agent capabilities. They provide structured instructions for common tasks.

## What is a Skill?

A skill is a markdown file (SKILL.md) containing:
- Frontmatter with metadata
- Instructions for the AI agent
- Examples and guidelines

## Where Skills Live

Skills are stored in `.claude/skills/` directories:

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `./.claude/skills/` | Project-specific skills |
| `~/.claude/skills/` | Global skills for all projects |

## Skill Discovery

AI agents automatically detect and load skills from these directories. When you ask an agent to perform a task, it can invoke matching skills.

## Built-in vs Custom Skills

### Built-in Skills

Some AI agents come with built-in skills for common tasks:
- Code generation
- Git operations
- File manipulation

### Custom Skills

You can create custom skills for:
- Team-specific workflows
- Domain knowledge
- Code style enforcement
- Review checklists

## Skill Examples

Common skill patterns include:

- **Code Review** - Enforce coding standards
- **Commit Messages** - Generate conventional commits
- **Documentation** - Write consistent docs
- **Testing** - Generate test cases
- **Refactoring** - Apply specific patterns
