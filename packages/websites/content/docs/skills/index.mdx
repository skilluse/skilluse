description: Understanding AI agent skills - domain knowledge + workflow automation
order: 20
---

A skill is an **executable SOP** that combines domain knowledge with workflow automation. It encodes both *how experts think* and *how work gets done*.

## The Dual Nature of Skills

| Dimension | What It Provides | Examples |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Domain Knowledge** | Expert reasoning, best practices, decision frameworks | Brand voice guidelines, analysis methodologies |
| **Workflow Automation** | Executable SOPs that orchestrate agent tools | Research → analyze → write → review pipelines |

## Tool Orchestration

Skills orchestrate the agent's native tools:

| Tool | What Skills Orchestrate |
|------|------------------------|
| **Bash** | git, docker, npm, aws, kubectl, and the entire CLI ecosystem |
| **Read** | Configuration, documents, data sources |
| **Write** | Reports, code, documents, structured outputs |
| **WebSearch** | Research, fact-checking, current information |
| **WebFetch** | Documentation, APIs, external resources |

**Bash is the universal connector**—bridging the agent to any tool with a command-line interface. This makes skills a natural replacement for workflow automation tools like n8n or Zapier.

## For Every Knowledge Worker

Skills aren't just for programmers:

- **Copywriters**: Brand voice, content frameworks, editorial standards
- **Data Analysts**: Analysis methodologies, visualization patterns, reporting SOPs
- **Marketers**: Campaign workflows, audience research, content strategies
- **Product Managers**: PRD templates, prioritization frameworks
- **Engineers**: Code review standards, deployment SOPs, architecture patterns
