SkillUse can be installed via npm, shell script, or run directly with npx.

## npm (Recommended)

Install SkillUse globally to use the `skilluse` command anywhere:

```bash
npm install -g skilluse
```

## Shell Script

For macOS and Linux, you can install directly:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://skilluse.dev/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest binary to `~/.local/bin/skilluse`.

After installation, verify it works:

```bash
skilluse --version
```

## Using npx

You can also run SkillUse without installing it:

```bash
npx skilluse --help
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or later
- npm, pnpm, or bun package manager

## Authentication

SkillUse requires GitHub authentication to install skills from private repositories. Run the login command:

```bash
skilluse login
```

This opens your browser for GitHub OAuth authentication. Once authenticated, you can access skills from your GitHub repositories.
