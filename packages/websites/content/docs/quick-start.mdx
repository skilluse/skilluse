# Quick Start

This guide walks you through creating your first skill and installing it in your project.

## Step 1: Create a Skill

Create a `.claude/skills/` directory in your project and add a skill file:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill
```

Create `SKILL.md` with frontmatter and instructions:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: A sample skill for demonstration
version: 1.0.0
---

# My Skill

This skill helps with [describe what it does].

## When to Use

Use this skill when [describe the scenario].

## Instructions

[Add your instructions here]
```

## Step 2: Test Locally

Your AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) will automatically detect skills in `.claude/skills/`. Test by asking your agent to use the skill.

## Step 3: Share Your Skill

To share skills across projects, push them to a GitHub repository. Then install with:

```bash
skilluse install owner/repo/path/to/skill
```

## Example Skills
