Every organization faces the same challenge: expertise lives in someone's head, scattered across documentation, or buried in Slack threads. When that expert is unavailable, work stalls. When they leave, institutional knowledge disappears.

AI agents like Claude Code introduced **Skills**—markdown files that give agents domain expertise. But skills created locally stay local. There's no standard way to share, discover, or distribute them.

**SkillUse changes that.**

## What Are Skills, Really?

A skill is more than documentation. It's an **executable SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)** that empowers AI agents with two complementary capabilities:

| Dimension | What It Provides |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Domain Knowledge** | Expert reasoning, best practices, decision frameworks |
| **Workflow Automation** | Executable SOPs that orchestrate agent tools |

This dual nature is what makes skills powerful. They encode *how experts think* and *how work gets done*.

## For Every Knowledge Worker

Skills aren't just for programmers. Any domain expert can encode their expertise:

- **Copywriters**: Brand voice guidelines, content frameworks, editorial standards
- **Data Analysts**: Analysis methodologies, visualization patterns, reporting SOPs
- **Marketers**: Campaign workflows, audience research, content strategies
- **Product Managers**: PRD templates, prioritization frameworks, research protocols
- **Researchers**: Literature review workflows, synthesis frameworks
- **Engineers**: Code review standards, deployment SOPs, architecture patterns

When you install a skill, you're not just sharing documentation—you're sharing *how an expert would approach the problem*.

## Tool Orchestration: The Agent's Hands

Skills orchestrate the agent's native tools to execute workflows:

| Tool | Capability |
|------|------------|
| **Bash** | Execute CLI commands (git, docker, npm, aws, kubectl...) |
| **Read** | Access files, configuration, data sources |
| **Write** | Create reports, code, documents, structured outputs |
| **WebSearch** | Research, fact-checking, current information |
| **WebFetch** | Documentation, APIs, external resources |

**Bash is the universal connector.** It bridges the agent to any tool with a command-line interface—version control, cloud infrastructure, databases, CI/CD systems.

This makes skills a natural replacement for workflow automation tools like n8n or Zapier, but with natural language orchestration instead of drag-and-drop UIs.

## A Practical Example

Consider a `publish` skill for releasing software. It doesn't just document the release process—it orchestrates:

1. **Read** changelog and version files
2. **Bash** run `git tag`, `npm version`, `gh release create`
3. **Write** update version numbers across files
4. **Validate** CI status before proceeding

The skill encodes both the *knowledge* (semantic versioning rules, changelog format) and the *workflow* (the exact commands and sequence).

## The Decentralized Registry

SkillUse treats skills as **first-class packages**—like npm for AI agent capabilities. But instead of a single centralized registry, it uses GitHub repositories as skill sources:

```bash
skilluse repo add company/internal-skills    # Private company skills
skilluse repo add anthropics/skill-library   # Public community skills
```

This enables:

- **Private skills** for proprietary workflows within organizations
- **Public skills** for open-source community patterns
- **Multi-source configuration** mixing internal and external repos

## Read + Write: A Complete Ecosystem

Most package managers are consumer-only. SkillUse is designed for **both consumption and creation**:

```bash
# Consume
skilluse search code-review
skilluse install code-review

# Create
skilluse repo init myname/my-skills
skilluse publish ./my-skill
```

This bidirectional flow creates a virtuous cycle: domain experts encode their knowledge into skills, teams consume and refine them, keeping expertise fresh and grounded in real practice.

## Multi-Agent Support

Skills aren't tied to a single AI agent. SkillUse installs skills to the correct location based on your current agent:

```bash
skilluse agent claude     # Install to ~/.claude/skills/
skilluse agent cursor     # Install to ~/.cursor/skills/
skilluse install review   # Goes to current agent's path
```

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install
npm install -g skilluse

# Authenticate with GitHub
skilluse login

# Add a skill repository
skilluse repo add anthropics/skill-library

# Search and install
skilluse search code-review
skilluse install code-review
```

## What's Next

We're building toward a future where:

- Every team has a skills repository encoding their best practices
- Domain experts—not just engineers—create and share skills
- AI agents apply organizational expertise automatically
- Workflow automation happens through natural language, not complex UIs

Skills are more than documentation. They're how we scale expertise.
