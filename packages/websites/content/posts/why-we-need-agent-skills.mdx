As AI agents become increasingly capable, we face a fundamental challenge: **how do we scale their expertise without hitting the limits of context windows?**

This post explores the architectural patterns emerging from Anthropic's research and the open standards being built to solve this problem.

## The Context Window Problem

Every AI agent operates within a finite context window—a limited "attention budget" that constrains how much information it can process at once. Research on context degradation shows that as token volume increases, model recall accuracy decreases.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B[Agent Context Window]
    B --> C{Context Full?}
    C -->|No| D[Process Request]
    C -->|Yes| E[Information Loss]
    E --> F[Degraded Performance]
    D --> G[Quality Response]

    style E fill:#ff6b6b
    style F fill:#ff6b6b
    style G fill:#51cf66
```

This creates a fundamental tension: agents need vast knowledge to be useful, but loading everything into context makes them less effective.

## Anthropic's Six Composable Patterns

Rather than building monolithic agents, [Anthropic's research on building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) identifies six composable patterns that scale elegantly:

### 1. Prompt Chaining

Decompose tasks into sequential steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input] --> B[Step 1]
    B --> C[Step 2]
    C --> D[Step 3]
    D --> E[Output]

    style A fill:#339af0
    style E fill:#51cf66
```

### 2. Routing

Classify inputs and direct them to specialized handlers. This is particularly powerful when distinct categories benefit from separate optimization.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input] --> B{Router}
    B -->|Code| C[Code Agent]
    B -->|Docs| D[Docs Agent]
    B -->|Data| E[Data Agent]
    C --> F[Output]
    D --> F
    E --> F

    style B fill:#ffd43b
```

### 3. Parallelization

Run independent subtasks simultaneously—either by sectioning work across parallel agents or by voting (running the same task multiple times for diverse outputs).

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task] --> B[Orchestrator]
    B --> C[Worker 1]
    B --> D[Worker 2]
    B --> E[Worker 3]
    C --> F[Aggregator]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[Result]

    style B fill:#339af0
    style F fill:#51cf66
```

### 4. Orchestrator-Workers

A central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates to worker LLMs, and synthesizes results. This suits unpredictable subtask requirements.

### 5. Evaluator-Optimizer

One LLM generates responses while another provides iterative feedback—useful when clear evaluation criteria exist.

### 6. Autonomous Agents

LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage. Best for open-ended problems where the number of steps is unpredictable.

## The Skills Solution

These patterns show *how* to structure agent architectures. But they don't solve the knowledge scaling problem: how do we give agents specialized expertise without overloading their context?

Enter **Agent Skills**—an open standard [originally developed by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills) and now adopted across the industry.

### What Are Skills?

A skill is simply a folder containing:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md      # Instructions + metadata
├── scripts/      # Optional executable code
└── references/   # Optional documentation
```

The `SKILL.md` file contains YAML frontmatter with metadata and markdown instructions:

```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for bugs, security issues, and best practices
---

# Code Reviewer

When reviewing code, follow these steps:
1. Check for security vulnerabilities
2. Identify potential bugs
3. Suggest performance improvements
...
```

### Progressive Disclosure Architecture

The genius of skills lies in **progressive disclosure**—loading information only when needed:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Agent Startup] --> B[Load Skill Metadata]
    B --> C[Names + Descriptions in System Prompt]

    D[User Request] --> E{Skill Relevant?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Load Full SKILL.md]
    E -->|No| G[Handle Directly]

    F --> H{Need Resources?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Load Specific Files]
    H -->|No| J[Execute with Instructions]

    I --> J
    J --> K[Response]
    G --> K

    style B fill:#339af0
    style F fill:#ffd43b
    style I fill:#ff6b6b
```

This three-level approach means:

1. **Level 1**: Only skill names and descriptions load at startup
2. **Level 2**: Full SKILL.md content loads when the agent determines relevance
3. **Level 3**: Additional resources load only as specific scenarios require

### Cross-Agent Interoperability

Skills work across multiple AI platforms:

| Agent | Skills Directory |
|-------|-----------------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/skills/` |
| VS Code | `.vscode/skills/` |
| Amp | `~/.amp/skills/` |

This means you can create a skill once and use it everywhere.

## The Scaling Architecture

Combining Anthropic's patterns with skills creates a powerful scaling architecture:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Skill Registry"
        S1[Code Review Skill]
        S2[Testing Skill]
        S3[Deploy Skill]
        S4[Docs Skill]
    end

    subgraph "Agent Architecture"
        A[Orchestrator Agent] --> B{Router}
        B --> C[Code Worker]
        B --> D[Test Worker]
        B --> E[Deploy Worker]
    end

    S1 -.->|loads when needed| C
    S2 -.->|loads when needed| D
    S3 -.->|loads when needed| E
    S4 -.->|loads when needed| A

    style A fill:#339af0
    style B fill:#ffd43b
```

This architecture provides:

- **Unlimited expertise**: Skills can contain effectively unlimited context since agents access only what's needed
- **Specialization without redesign**: General-purpose agents become domain-specific agents by loading relevant skills
- **Determinism**: Bundled scripts provide reliable, repeatable execution for operations better suited to code than token generation

## Long-Running Agent Sessions

For agents that work across multiple sessions, [Anthropic's research on effective harnesses](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) introduces additional patterns:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent
    participant Progress as progress.txt
    participant Git

    User->>Agent: Start Session
    Agent->>Progress: Read previous state
    Agent->>Git: Check recent commits
    Agent->>Agent: Verify baseline works

    loop For Each Feature
        Agent->>Agent: Implement feature
        Agent->>Agent: Test feature
        Agent->>Git: Commit changes
        Agent->>Progress: Update status
    end

    Agent->>User: Session complete
```

Key mechanisms for state persistence:

1. **Progress files**: Track completed work across sessions
2. **Git history**: Provide clear record of changes
3. **Feature lists**: Maintain passing/failing status to prevent premature completion

## Getting Started

### Install Skills

Using [AI Agent Skills](https://github.com/skillcreatorai/Ai-Agent-Skills), the universal installer:

```bash
# Browse available skills
npx ai-agent-skills browse

# Install a skill
npx ai-agent-skills install code-reviewer

# Install from GitHub
npx ai-agent-skills install anthropics/skills/skill-creator
```

### Create Your Own Skills

1. Create a folder with a `SKILL.md` file
2. Add instructions in markdown
3. Optionally add scripts for deterministic operations
4. Install to your agent's skills directory

Or use [SkillCreator.ai](https://www.skillcreator.ai/) to generate skills from natural language descriptions.

## Conclusion

Scaling AI agents isn't about building bigger context windows—it's about building smarter architectures. The combination of:

- **Composable patterns** for agent structure
- **Progressive disclosure** for knowledge loading
- **Open standards** for interoperability

...creates a foundation for agents that can grow their expertise indefinitely while maintaining performance.

The future of AI agents is modular, portable, and skill-based.
